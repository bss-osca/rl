    "section": "1.2 Purpose of the course",
    "text": "1.2 Purpose of the course\nThe purpose of this course is to give an introduction and knowledge about reinforcement learning (RL).\nRL may be seen as\n\nAn approach of modelling sequential decision making problems.\nAn approach for learning good decision making under uncertainty from experience.\nMathematical models for learning-based decision making.\nTrying to optimize decisions in a sequential decision model. That is, making a good sequence of decisions.\nEstimating and finding near optimal decisions of a stochastic process with sequential decision making.\nA model where given a state of a system, the agent wants to take actions to maximize future reward. Often the agent does not know the underlying setting and, thus, is bound to learn from experience.\n\nRL can also be seen as a way of modelling intuition. As humans, we often learn by trial and error. For instance, when playing a game, our strategy is based on the game rules and what we have experienced works based on previous plays. In a RL setting, the system has specific states, actions and reward structure, that is, the rules of the game, and it is up to the agent how to solve the game, i.e. find actions that maximize the reward. Typically, the agent starts with totally random trials and finishes with sophisticated tactics and superhuman skills. By leveraging the power of search and many trials, RL is an effective way to find good actions.\nA classic RL example is the bandit problem: You are in a casino and want to choose one of many slot machines (one-armed bandits) in each round. However, you do not know the distribution of the payouts of the machines. In the beginning, you will probably just try out machines (exploration) and then, after some learning, you will prefer the best ones (exploitation). Now the problem arises that if you use a slot machine frequently, you will not be able to gain information about the others and may not even find the best machine (exploration-exploitation dilemma). RL focuses on finding a balance between exploration of uncharted territory and exploitation of current knowledge.\nThe course starts by giving a general overview over RL and introducing bandit problems. Next, the mathematical framework of Markov decision processes (MDPs) is given as a classical formalization of sequential decision making. In this case, actions influence not just immediate rewards, but also subsequent situations, or states, and therefore also future rewards. An MDP assumes that the dynamics of the underlying process and the reward structure are known explicitly by the decision maker. In the last part of the course, we go beyond the case of decision making in known environments and study RL methods for stochastic control.",

As an agent, you base your decision on the current state of the system (a state is a function of the information/data available). At the next time-step, the system have moved (stochastically) to the next stage. Here new information may be available and you receive a reward and take a new action. Examples of sequential decision problems are (with possible actions):\n\nPlaying backgammon (how to move the checkers).\nDriving a car (left, right, forward, back, break, stop, …).\nHow to invest/maintain a portfolio of stocks (buy, sell, amount).\n\nControl an inventory (wait, buy, amount).\nVehicle routing (routes).\nMaintain a spare-part (wait, maintain).\nRobot operations (sort, move, …)\nDairy cow treatment/replacement (treat, replace, …)\nRecommender systems e.g. Netflix recommendations (videos)\n\nSince RL involves a scalar reward signal, the goal is to choose actions such that the total reward is maximized.

    "section": "2.4 RL and Business Analytics",
    "text": "2.4 RL and Business Analytics\nBusiness Analytics (BA) (or just Analytics) refers to the scientific process of transforming data into insight for making better decisions in business. BA can both be seen as the complete decision making process for solving a business problem or as a set of methodologies that enable the creation of business value. As a process it can be characterized by descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive model building using “big” data sources.\nDescriptive Analytics: A set of technologies and processes that use data to understand and analyze business performance. Descriptive analytics are the most commonly used and most well understood type of analytics. Descriptive analytics categorizes, characterizes, consolidates, and classifies data. Examples are standard reporting and dashboards (KPIs, what happened or is happening now?) and ad-hoc reporting (how many/often?). Descriptive analytics often serves as a first step in the successful application of predictive or prescriptive analytics.\nPredictive Analytics: The use of data and statistical techniques to make predictions about future outputs/outcomes, identify patterns or opportunities for business performance. Examples of techniques are data mining (what data is correlated with other data?), pattern recognition and alerts (when should I take action to correct/adjust a spare part?), Monte-Carlo simulation (what could happen?), neural networks (which customer group are best?) and forecasting (what if these trends continue?).\nPrescriptive Analytics: The use of optimization and other decision modelling techniques using the results of descriptive and predictive analytics to suggest decision options with the goal of improving business performance. Prescriptive analytics attempt to quantify the effect of future decisions in order to advise on possible outcomes before the decisions are actually made. Prescriptive analytics predicts not only what will happen, but also why it will happen and provides recommendations regarding actions that will take advantage of the predictions. Prescriptive analytics are relatively complex to administer, and most companies are not yet using it in their daily course of business. However, when implemented correctly, it can have a huge impact on business performance and how businesses make decisions. Examples on prescriptive analytics are optimization in production planning and scheduling, inventory management, the supply chain and transportation planning. Since RL focus optimizing decisions it is Prescriptive Analytics also known as sequential decision analytics.\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Analytics and competive advantage.\n\n\n\n\nCompanies who use BA focus on fact-based management to drive decision making and treats data and information as a strategic asset that is shared within the company. This enterprise approach generates a companywide respect for applying descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics in areas such as supply chain, marketing and human resources. Focusing on BA gives a company a competive advantage (see Figure @ref(fig:analytics)).\nBA and related areas: In the past Business Intelligence traditionally focuses on querying, reporting, online analytical processing, i.e. descriptive analytics. However, a more modern definition of Business Intelligence is the union of descriptive and predictive analytics. Operations Research or Management Science deals with the application of advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions and can hence be seen as prescriptive analytics. However, traditionally it has been taking a more theoretical approach and focusing on problem-driven research while BA takes a more data-driven approach. Logistics is a cross-functional area focusing on the effective and efficient flows of goods and services, and the related flows of information and cash. Supply Chain Management adds a process-oriented and cross-company perspective. Both can be seen as prescriptive analytics with a more problem-driven research focus. Advanced Analytics is often used as a classification of both predictive and prescriptive analytics. Data science is an interdisciplinary field about scientific methods, processes, and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured and can be seen as Business analytics applied to a wider range of data.",

Different strategies for defining a state may be considered. Choosing \\(S_t = H_t\\) is bad since the size of a state representation grows very fast. A better strategy is to just store the information needed for taking the next action. Moreover, it is good to have Markov states where given the present state the future is independent of the past. That is, the current state holds just as much information as the history, i.e. it holds all useful information of the history. Symbolically, we call a state \\(S_t\\) Markov iff\n\\[\\Pr[S_{t+1} | S_t] = \\Pr[S_{t+1} | S_1,...,S_t].\\]\nThat is, the probability of seeing some next state \\(S_{t+1}\\) given the current state is exactly equal to the probability of that next state given the entire history of states. Note that we can always find some Markov state. Though the smaller the state, the more “valuable” it is. In the worst case, \\(H_t\\) is Markov, since it represents all known information about itself.\nThe reward \\(R_t\\) is a number representing the reward at time \\(t\\) (negative if a cost). Examples of rewards are\n\nPlaying backgammon (0 (when play), 1 (when win), -1 (when loose)).\nHow to invest/maintain a portfolio of stocks (the profit).\n\nControl an inventory (inventory cost, lost sales cost).\nVehicle routing (transportation cost).\n\nThe goal is to find a policy that maximize the total future reward. A policy is the agent’s behaviour and is a map from state to action, i.e. a function \\[a = \\pi(s)\\] saying that given the agent is in state \\(s\\) we choose action \\(a\\).\nThe total future reward is currently not defined clearly. Let the value function denote the future reward in state \\(s\\) and define it as the expected discounted future reward: \\[V_\\pi(s) = \\mathbb{E}_\\pi(R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \\ldots | S = s).\\] Note the value function is defined using a specific policy and the goal is to find a policy that maximize the total future reward in all possible states \\[\\pi^* = \\arg\\max_{\\pi\\in\\Pi}(V_\\pi(s)).\\]\nThe value of the discount rate is important:\n\nDiscount rate \\(\\gamma=0\\): Only care about present reward.\nDiscount rate \\(\\gamma=1\\): Future reward is as beneficial as immediate reward. Can be used if the time-horizon is finite.\nDiscount rate \\(\\gamma&lt;1\\): Rewards near to the present more beneficial. Note \\(V(s)\\) will converge to a number even if the time-horizon is infinite.",

    "text": "2.9 Exploitation vs Exploration\nA key problem of reinforcement learning (in general) is the difference between exploration and exploitation. Should the agent sacrifice what is currently known as the best action to explore a (possibly) better opportunity, or should it just exploit its best possible policy? Exploitation takes the action assumed to be optimal with respect to the data observed so far. This, gives better predictions of the value function (given the current policy) but prevents the agent from discovering potential better decisions (a better policy). Exploration does not take the action that seems to be optimal. That is, the agent explore to find new states and update the value function for this state.\nExamples in the exploration and exploitation dilemma are for instance movie recommendations: recommending the user’s best rated movie type (exploitation) or trying another movie type (exploration) or oil drilling: drilling at the best known location (exploitation) or trying a new location (exploration).",

That is, the current state of the board is the players’ marks on the grid. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. Reward for a player is 1 for ‘win’, 0.5 for ‘draw’, and 0 for ‘loss’. These values can be seen as the probability of winning.\n\n\n\nExamples of winning, loosing and a draw from player Xs point of view:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nX\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nO\n\n\nO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n.\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nX\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nO\n\n\nO\n\n\nO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nO\n\n\n\n\nO\n\n\nO\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe start with an empty board and have at most 9 moves (a player may win before).

    "text": "3.6 Exercises\nBelow you will find a set of exercises. Always have a look at the exercises before you meet in your study group and try to solve them yourself. Are you stuck, see the help page. Sometimes hints and solutions can be revealed. Beware, you will not learn by giving up too early. Put some effort into finding a solution!\nYou can find all these exercises as a section in this Colab notebook. If you already have your own copy use this.\n\n3.6.1 Exercise - Self-Play\nConsider Tic-Tac-Toe and assume that instead of an RL player against a random opponent, the reinforcement learning algorithm described above played against itself. What do you think would happen in this case? Would it learn a different way of playing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the exploration parameter is non-zero, the algorithm will continue to adapt until it reaches an equilibrium (either fixed or cyclical). You may try to code it.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.2 Exercise - Symmetries\nMany tic-tac-toe positions appear different but are really the same because of symmetries.\n\nHow might we amend the reinforcement learning algorithm described above to take advantage of this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is possible to use 4 axis of symmetry to essentially fold the board down to a quarter of the size.\n\n\n\nIn what ways would this improve the algorithm?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nA smaller state space would increase the speed of learning and reduce the memory required.\n\n\n\nSuppose the opponent did not take advantage of symmetries. In that case, should we? Is it true, then, that symmetrically equivalent positions should necessarily have the same value?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the opponent did not use symmetries then it could result in a worse learning. For example, if the opponent always played correct except for 1 corner, then using symmetries would mean you never take advantage of that information. That is, we should not use symmetries too since symmetrically equivalent positions do not always hold the same value in such a game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.3 Exercise - Greedy Play\nConsider Tic-Tac-Toe and suppose the RL player is only greedy (\\(\\epsilon = 0\\)), that is, always playing the move that that gives the highest probability of winning. Would it learn to play better, or worse, than a non-greedy player? What problems might occur?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in Section @ref(rl-intro-tic-learn) using \\(\\epsilon = 0\\) may be okay for this game if the opponent use a simple strategy (e.g. random or first index). However, in general the RL player would play worse. The chance the optimal action is the one with the current best estimate of winning is low and depending on the gameplay the RL player might win or loose. The RL player would also be unable to adapt to an opponent that slowly alter behavior over time. required.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.4 Exercise - Learning from Exploration\nConsider Tic-Tac-Toe and suppose the RL player is playing against an opponent with a fixed strategy. Suppose learning updates occur after all moves, including exploratory moves. If the step-size parameter is appropriately reduced over time (but not the tendency to explore), then the state values would converge to a set of probabilities.\n\nWhat are the two sets of probabilities computed when we do, and when we do not, learn from exploratory moves?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe probability set \\(V(s)\\) found by applying no learning from exploration is the probability of winning when using the optimal policy. The probability set \\(V(s)\\) found by applying learning from exploration is the probability of winning including the active exploration policy.\n\n\n\nAssuming that we do continue to make exploratory moves, which set of probabilities might be better to learn? Which would result in more wins?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe probability set found by applying no learning from exploration would result in more wins. The probability set found by applying learning from exploration is better to learn, as it reduces variance from sub-optimal future states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.5 Exercise - Other Improvements\nConsider Tic-Tac-Toe. Can you think of other ways to improve the reinforcement learning player?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nAltering the exploration rate/learning based on the variance in the opponent’s actions. If the opponent is always making the same moves and you are winning from it then using a non-zero exploration rate will make you lose you games. If the agent is able to learn how the opponent may react to certain moves, it will be easier for it to win as it can influence the opponent to make moves that leads it to a better state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSutton, R.

    "text": "5.3 The k-armed bandit problem\nMulti-armed bandits attempt to find the best option among a collection of alternatives by learning through trial and error. The name derives from “one-armed bandit,” a slang term for a slot machine — which is a perfect analogy for how these algorithms work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: A 4-armed bandit.\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine you are facing a wall with \\(k\\) slot machines (see Figure 5.1), and each one pays out at a different rate. A natural way to figure out how to make the most money (rewards) would be to try each at random for a while (exploration), and start playing the higher paying ones once you have gained some experience (exploitation). That is, from an agent/environment point of view the agent considers a single state \\(s\\) at time \\(t\\) and have to choose among \\(k\\) actions given the environment representing the \\(k\\) bandits. Only the rewards from the \\(k\\) bandits are unknown, but the agent observe samples of the reward of an action and can use this to estimate the expected reward of that action. The objective is to find an optimal policy that maximize the total expected reward. Note since the process only have a single state, this is the same as finding an optimal policy \\(\\pi^*(s) = \\pi^* = a^*\\) that chooses the action with the highest expected reward. Due to uncertainty, there is an exploration vs exploitation dilemma. The agent have one action that seems to be most valuable at a time point, but it is highly likely, at least initially, that there are actions yet to explore that are more valuable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-armed bandits can be used in e.g. digital advertising. Suppose you are an advertiser seeking to optimize which ads (\\(k\\) to choose among) to show visitors on a particular website. For each visitor, you can choose one out of a collection of ads, and your goal is to maximize the number of clicks over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Which ad to choose?\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is reasonable to assume that each of these ads will have different effects, and some will be more engaging than others. That is, each ad has some theoretical — but unknown — click-through-rate (CTR) that is assumed to not change over time. How do we go about solving which ad we should choose (see Figure 5.2)?",

Instead an incremental approach is better. If we assume that \\(N_t(a) = n-1\\) and set \\(Q_t(a) = Q_n\\) then \\(Q_{n+1}\\) becomes: \\[\\begin{align}\\label{eq:avg}\n  Q_{n+1} &= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}R_i \\nonumber \\\\\n            &= \\frac{1}{n}\\left( R_{n} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} R_i \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n            &= \\frac{1}{n}\\left( R_{n} + (n-1)\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} R_i \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n            &= \\frac{1}{n}\\left( R_{n} + (n-1)Q_n \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n           &= Q_n + \\frac{1}{n} \\left[R_n - Q_n\\right].\n\\end{align}\\] That is, we can update the estimate of the value of \\(a\\) using the previous estimate, the observed reward and how many times the action has occurred (\\(n\\)).\nA greedy approach for selecting the next action is \\[\\begin{equation}\nA_t =\\arg \\max_a Q_t(a).\n\\end{equation}\\] Here \\(\\arg\\max_a\\) means the value of \\(a\\) for which \\(Q_t(a)\\) is maximised.

However, if the process is non-stationary, i.e. the expected reward of an action change over time, then convergence is undesirable and we may want to use a constant \\(\\alpha_n(a)= \\alpha \\in (0, 1]\\) instead. This results in (Q_{n+1}) being a weighted average of the past rewards and the initial estimate (Q_1):\n\\[\\begin{align}\nQ_{n+1} &= Q_n +\\alpha \\left[R_n - Q_n\\right] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\alpha R_n + (1 - \\alpha)Q_n \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\alpha R_n + (1 - \\alpha)[\\alpha R_{n-1} + (1 - \\alpha)Q_{n-1}] \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\alpha R_n + (1 - \\alpha)\\alpha R_{n-1} + (1 - \\alpha)^2 Q_{n-1}  \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\vdots \\nonumber \\\\\n&= (1-\\alpha)^n Q_1 + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\alpha (1 - \\alpha)^{n-i} R_i \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nBecause the weight given to each reward depends on how long ago it was observed, we can see that more recent rewards are given more weight.

    "text": "6.1 Learning outcomes\nThis module gives an introduction to Markov decision processes (MDPs) with a finite number of states and actions. This gives us a full model of a sequential decision problem. MDPs are a classical formalization of sequential decision making, where actions influence not just immediate rewards, but also what will be the next state, and hence future rewards. Thus MDPs involve delayed reward and the need to consider the trade-off between immediate and delayed reward. MDPs are a mathematically idealized form of the RL problem where a full description is known and the optimal policy can be found. Often in a RL problem some parts of this description is unknown and we hereby have to estimate the best policy by learning. For example, in the bandit problem the rewards was unknown.\nBy the end of this module, you are expected to:\nThe learning outcomes relate to the overall learning goals number 2, 7, 10, and 12 of the course.",

    "text": "6.3 An MDP as a model for the agent-environment\nLet us recall the RL problem which considers an agent in an environment:\n\nAgent: The one who takes the action (computer, robot, decision maker), i.e. the decision making component of a system. Everything else is the environment. A general rule is that anything that the agent does not have absolute control over forms part of the environment.\nEnvironment: The system/world where observations and rewards are found.\n\nAt time step \\(t\\) the agent is in state \\(S_t\\) and takes action \\(A_{t}\\) and observe the new state \\(S_{t+1}\\) and reward \\(R_{t+1}\\):\n\n\n\n\n\nAgent-environment representation.\n\n\n\n\nNote we here assume that the Markov property is satisfied and the current state holds just as much information as the history of observations. That is, given the present state the future is independent of the past:\n\\[\\Pr(S_{t+1} | S_t, A_t) = \\Pr(S_{t+1} | S_1,...,S_t, A_t).\\] That is, the probability of seeing some next state \\(S_{t+1}\\) given the current state is exactly equal to the probability of that next state given the entire history of states.\nA Markov decision process (MDP) is a mathematical model that for each time-step \\(t\\) have defined states \\(S_t \\in \\mathcal{S}\\), possible actions \\(A_t \\in \\mathcal{A}(s)\\) given a state and rewards \\(R_t \\in \\mathcal{R} \\subset \\mathbb{R}\\). Consider the example in Figure @ref(fig:hgf1). Each time-step have five states \\(\\mathcal{S} = \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}\\). Assume that the agent start in state \\(s_0\\) with two actions to choose among \\(\\mathcal{A}(s_0) = \\{a_1, a_2\\}\\). After choosing \\(a_1\\) a transition to \\(s_1\\) happens with reward \\(R_1 = r_1\\). Next, in state \\(s_1\\) the agent chooses action \\(a_2\\) and a transition to \\(s_2\\) happens with reward \\(r_2\\). This continues as time evolves.\n\n\n\n\n\nState-expanded hypergraph\n\n\n\n\nIn a finite MDP, the sets of states, actions, and rewards all have a finite number of elements. In this case, the random variables have well defined discrete probability distributions dependent only on the preceding state and action which defines the dynamics of the system: \\[\\begin{equation}\n    p(s', r | s, a) = \\Pr(S_t = s', R_t = r | S_{t-1} = s, A_{t-1} = a),\n\\end{equation}\\] which can be used to find the transition probabilities: \\[\\begin{equation}\n    p(s' | s, a) = \\Pr(S_t = s'| S_{t-1} = s, A_{t-1}=A) = \\sum_{r \\in \\mathcal{R}} p(s', r | s, a),\n\\end{equation}\\] and the expected reward: \\[\\begin{equation}\n    r(s, a) = \\mathbb{E}[R_t | S_{t-1} = s, A_{t-1} = a] = \\sum_{r \\in \\mathcal{R}} r \\sum_{s' \\in \\mathcal{S}} p(s', r | s, a).\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThat is, to define an MDP the following are needed:\n\nA finite number of states and actions. That is, we can store values using tabular methods.\nAll states \\(S \\in \\mathcal{S}\\) and actions \\(A \\in \\mathcal{A}(s)\\) are known.\n\nThe transition probabilities \\(p(s' | s, a)\\) and expected rewards \\(r(s, a)\\) are given. Alternatively, \\(p(s', r | s, a)\\).\n\nMoreover, for now a stationary MDP is considered, i.e. at each time-step all states, actions and probabilities are the same and hence the time index can be dropped.",

    "text": "6.4 Rewards and the objective function (goal)\nThe reward hypothesis is a central assumption in reinforcement learning:\n\nAll of what we mean by goals and purposes can be well thought of as the maximisation of the expected value of the cumulative sum of a received scalar signal (called reward).\n\nThis assumption can be questioned but in this course we assume it holds. The reward signal is our way of communicating to the agent what we want to achieve not how we want to achieve it.\nThe return \\(G_t\\) can be defined as the sum of future rewards; however, if the time horizon is infinite the return is also infinite. Hence we use a discount rate \\(0 \\leq \\gamma \\leq 1\\) and define the return as\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n    G_t = R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \\cdots = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^k R_{t+k+1}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nDiscounting is important since it allows us to work with finite returns because if \\(\\gamma &lt; 1\\) and the reward is bounded by a number \\(B\\) then the return is always finite:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nG_t = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^k R_{t+k+1} \\leq B \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^k  = B \\frac{1}{1 - \\gamma}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nNote gamma close to one put weight on future rewards while a gamma close to zero put weight on present rewards. Moreover, an infinite time-horizon is assumed.\nAn MDP modelling a problem over a finite time-horizon can be transformed into an infinite time-horizon using an absorbing state with transitions only to itself and a reward of zero. This breaks the agent-environment interaction into episodes (e.g playing a board game). Each episode ends in the absorbing state, possibly with a different reward. Each starts independently of the last, with some distribution of starting states. Sequences of interaction without an absorbing state are called continuing tasks.\nThe objective function is to choose actions such that the expected return is maximized. We will formalize this mathematically in the next module.",

The coin may be an unequal coin where there is not equal probability \\(p_H\\) for a head (H) and a tail (T). If the coin comes up heads, the gambler wins as many dollars as he has staked on that flip; if it is tails, he loses his stake. The game ends when the gambler reaches his goal of a capital equal 100, or loses by running out of money. On each flip, the gambler must decide what portion of his capital to stake, in integer numbers of dollars.

At the end of each week there is a regular opportunity to remove all waste from the storage tank at a fixed cost of $25 and a variable cost of $5 per cubic metre.\nThe problem can be modelled as a finite MDP where a state denote the amount of waste in the tank at the end of week \\(n\\) just before the regular removal opportunity.\n\nDefine the state space \\(\\mathcal{S}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\mathcal{S} = \\{ 0,1,2,3,4 \\}\\]\n\n\n\nDefine the action space \\(\\mathcal{A}(s)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(e\\) and \\(k\\) denote empty and keep the waste from the tank.

Given the definition of q-values, the state-value function is an average over the q-values of all actions we could take in that state:\n\\[\nv_\\pi(s) = \\sum_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}}\\pi(a|s)q_\\pi(s, a)\n\\tag{7.1}\\]\nA q-value (action-value) is equal to the expected reward \\(r(s,a)\\) that we get from choosing action \\(a\\) in state \\(s\\), plus a discounted amount of the average state-value of all the future states:\n\\[q_\\pi(s, a) = r(s,a) + \\gamma\\sum_{s' \\in \\mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) v_\\pi(s')\\]\nJoining the equations, the state-value of a particular state \\(s\\) now becomes the sum of weighted state-values of all possible subsequent states \\(s'\\), where the weights are the policy probabilities:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n  v_\\pi(s) &= \\sum_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}}\\pi(a | s)q_\\pi(s, a) \\\\\n  &= \\sum_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}}\\pi(a | s)\\left( r(s,a) + \\gamma\\sum_{s' \\in \\mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) v_\\pi(s')\\right),\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{7.2}\\] which is known as the Bellman equation.",

Note the objective function is not a scalar here but if the agent start in state \\(s_0\\) then we may reformulate the objective function maximize the expected return to \\[v_*(s_0) = \\max_\\pi \\mathbb{E}_\\pi[G_0 | S_0 = s_0] = \\max_\\pi v_\\pi(s_0)\\]\nIf the MDP has the right properties (details are not given here), there exists an optimal deterministic policy \\(\\pi_*\\) which is better than or just as good as all other policies. For all such optimal policies (there may be more than one), we only need to find one optimal policy that have the optimal state-value function \\((v_*)\\).\nWe may rewrite \\(v_*(s)\\) using Equation 7.1: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n  v_*(s) &= \\max_\\pi v_\\pi(s) \\\\\n         &= \\max_\\pi \\sum_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}}\\pi(a|s)q_\\pi(s, a) \\\\\n         &= \\max_\\pi \\max_a q_\\pi(s, a)\\qquad \\text{(set $\\pi(a|s) = 1$ where $q_\\pi$ is maximal)} \\\\\n         &= \\max_a \\max_\\pi q_\\pi(s, a) \\\\\n         &= \\max_a q_*(s, a), \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\] where the optimal q-value/action-value function \\((q_*)\\) is:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nq_*(s, a) &= \\max_\\pi q_\\pi(s, a) \\\\\n          &= r(s,a) + \\gamma\\sum_{s' \\in \\mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) v_*(s') \\\\\n          &= r(s,a) + \\gamma\\sum_{s' \\in \\mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) \\max_{a'} q_*(s', a').\n\\end{align}\n\\] This is the the Bellman optimality equation for \\(q_*\\) and the optimal policy is:\n\\[\n\\pi_*(a | s) =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 \\text{ if } a = \\arg\\max_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} q_*(s, a) \\\\\n0 \\text { otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n\\] Or we may define a deterministic policy as \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\pi_*(s) &= \\arg\\max_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} q_*(s, a) \\\\\n         &= \\arg\\max_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\left(r(s,a) + \\gamma\\sum_{s' \\in \\mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) v_*(s')\\right).\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{7.3}\\]\nSimilar we can write the Bellman optimality equation for \\(v_*\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n  v_*(s) &= \\max_a q_*(s, a) \\\\\n         &= \\max_a r(s,a) + \\gamma\\sum_{s' \\in \\mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) v_*(s')\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{7.4}\\]\nNote the Bellman equations define our state-value and q-value function, while the Bellman optimality equations define how to find the optimal value functions. Using (v_*), the optimal expected long term return is turned into a quantity that is immediately available for each state. On the other hand if we do not store \\(v_*\\), we can find \\(v_*\\) by a one-step-ahead search using \\(q_*\\), acting greedy.",

Consider a state \\(s = (x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) with state variables \\(x_i\\) each taking two possible values, then the number of states is \\(|\\mathcal{S}| = 2^n\\).

As a result we need to approximate the value functions because calculation of optimality is too expensive. This is indeed what happens in RL where we approximate the expected return.

Are you stuck, see the help page. Sometimes hints and solutions can be revealed. Beware, you will not learn by giving up too early. Put some effort into finding a solution!\n\n7.8.1 Exercise - Optimal policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: A simple MDP.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the transition diagram for an MDP shown in Figure 7.1 with 3 states (white circles). The only decision to be made is that in the top state \\(s\\), where two actions are available, left and right. The numbers show the rewards that are received deterministically after each action. There are exactly two deterministic policies left and right. Which policy is optimal if \\(\\gamma = 0, 0.9\\) and \\(0.5\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(\\pi_L\\) and \\(\\pi_R\\) denote the left and right policy, respectively. Recall the Bellman equation: \\[v_\\pi(s) = \\sum_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}}\\pi(a | s)\\left( r(s,a) + \\gamma\\sum_{s' \\in \\mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) v_\\pi(s')\\right).\\] For the left policy this reduces to \\[v_{\\pi_L}(s) = 1 + \\gamma(v_\\pi(s')) = 1 + \\gamma(0 + \\gamma v_{\\pi_L}(s)).\\] Isolating \\(v_{\\pi_L}(s)\\) gives us \\[v_{\\pi_L}(s) = 1/(1-\\gamma^2).\\] Similar for the right policy we get \\[v_{\\pi_R}(s) = 0 + \\gamma(v_\\pi(s')) = 0 + \\gamma(2 + \\gamma v_{\\pi_R}(s)).\\] Isolating \\(v_{\\pi_R}(s)\\) gives us \\[v_{\\pi_R}(s) = 2\\gamma/(1-\\gamma^2).\\] Now\n\nfor \\(\\gamma=0\\) we get \\(v_{\\pi_L}(s) = 1\\) and \\(v_{\\pi_R}(s) = 0\\), i.e. left policy optimal.\nfor \\(\\gamma=0.9\\) we get \\(v_{\\pi_L}(s) = 5.26\\) and \\(v_{\\pi_R}(s) = 9.47\\), i.e. right policy optimal.\nfor \\(\\gamma=0.5\\) we get \\(v_{\\pi_L}(s) = 1.33\\) and \\(v_{\\pi_R}(s) = 1.33\\), i.e. both policies optimal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.8.2 Exercise - Car rental\nConsider a rental company with two locations, each with a capacity of 20 cars. Each day, customers arrive at each location to rent cars. If a car is available, it is rented out with a reward of $10. Otherwise the opportunity is lost. Cars become available for renting the day after they are returned.\nThe number of cars rental requests \\(D_i\\) at Location \\(i=1,2\\) are Poisson distributed with mean 3 and 4. Similar, the number of cars returned \\(H_i\\) at Location \\(i=1,2\\) are Poisson distributed with mean 3 and 2. Cars returned resulting in more cars than the capacity are lost (and thus disappear from the problem).\nTo ensure that cars are available where they are needed, they can be moved between the two locations overnight, at a cost of $2 per car. A maximum of five cars can be moved from one location to the other in one night.\nFormulate the problem as an finite MDP where the time-steps are days.\n\nDefine the state space (with states \\((x,y)\\)) equal the number of cars at each location at the end of the day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\mathcal{S} = \\{ (x,y) | 0 \\leq x \\leq 20, 0 \\leq y \\leq 20 \\}\\]\n\n\n\n\nDefine the action space equal the net numbers of cars moved from Location 1 to Location 2 overnight, i.e. negative if move from Location 2 to 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\mathcal{A}(s) = \\{ a | -\\min(5,y,20-x) \\leq a \\leq min(5,x,20-y) \\}\\]\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the expected reward \\(r(s,a)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reward equals the reward of rentals minus the cost of movements. Note we have \\(\\bar{x} = x - a\\) and \\(\\bar{y} = x + a\\) after movement. Hence \\[r(s,a) = \\mathbb{E}[10(\\min(D_1, \\bar{x}) + \\min(D_2, \\bar{y}) )-2\\mid a \\mid]\\] where \\[\\mathbb{E}[\\min(D, z)] = \\sum_{i=0}^z ip(D = i) + (1-p(D\\leq z))z.\\]\n\n\n\nNote the inventory dynamics (number of cars) at each parking lot is independent of the other given an action \\(a\\). Let us consider Location 1 and assume that we are in state \\(x\\) and chose action \\(a\\). Then the number of cars after movement is \\(x - a\\) and after rental requests \\(x - a - \\min(D_1, x-a)\\). Next, the number of returned cars are added: \\(x - a - \\min(D_1, x-a) +  H_1\\). Finally, note that if this number is above 20 (parking lot capacity), then we only have 20 cars, i.e. the inventory dynamics (number of cars at the end of the day) is \\[X = \\min(20,  x-a - \\min(D_1, x-a) +  H_1))).\\]\n\nGive the inventory dynamics for Location 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly difference is that cars moved to Location 2 is \\(a\\) (and not \\(-a\\)): \\[Y = \\min(20, y + a - \\min(D_2, y+a) + H_2)).\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSutton, R.

    "text": "8.1 Learning outcomes\nThe term Dynamic Programming (DP) refers to a collection of algorithms that can be used to compute optimal policies of a model with full information about the dynamics, e.g. a Markov Decision Process (MDP). A DP model must satisfy the principle of optimality. That is, an optimal policy must consist for optimal sub-polices or alternatively the optimal value function in a state can be calculated using optimal value functions in future states. This is indeed what is described with the Bellman optimality equations.\nDP do both policy evaluation (prediction) and control. Policy evaluation give us the value function \\(v_\\pi\\) given a policy \\(\\pi\\). Control refer to finding the best policy or optimizing the value function. This can be done using the Bellman optimality equations.\nTwo main problems arise with DP. First, often we do not have full information about the MDP model, e.g. the rewards or transition probabilities are unknown. Second, we need to calculate the value function in all states using the rewards, actions, and transition probabilities. Hence, using DP may be computationally expensive if we have a large number of states and actions.\nNote the term programming in DP have nothing to do with a computer program but comes from that the mathematical model is called a “program”.\nBy the end of this module, you are expected to:\nThe learning outcomes relate to the overall learning goals number 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12 of the course.",

This linear system can be solved using e.g. some software. However, inverting the matrix can be computationally expensive for a large state space. Instead we consider an iterative method and a sequence of value function approximations \\(v_0, v_1, v_2, \\ldots\\), with initial approximation \\(v_0\\) chosen arbitrarily e.g. \\(v_0(s) = 0 \\:  \\forall s\\) (ensuring terminal state = 0).

    "text": "8.6 Value Iteration\nPolicy iteration requires full policy evaluation at each iteration step. This could be an computationally expensive process which requires may sweeps of the state space. In value iteration, the policy evaluation is stopped after one sweep of the state space. Value iteration is achieved by turning the Bellman optimality equation into an update rule: \\[\nv_{k+1}(s) = \\max_a \\left(r(s,a) + \\gamma\\sum_{s'} p(s'|s, a)v_k(s')\\right)\n\\] Value iteration effectively combines, in each of its sweeps, one sweep of policy evaluation and one sweep of policy improvement, since it performs a greedy update while also evaluating the current policy. Also, it is important to understand that the value-iteration algorithm does not require a policy to work. No actions have to be chosen. Rather, the state-values are updated and after the last step of value-iteration the optimal policy \\(\\pi_*\\) is found:\n\\[\n\\pi_*(s) = \\arg\\max_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\left(r(s,a) + \\gamma\\sum_{s' \\in \\mathcal{S}} p(s' | s, a) v_*(s')\\right),\n\\] The algorithm is given in Figure Figure 8.3. Since we do not want an infinite number of iterations we introduce a threshold \\(\\theta\\). The sequence of calculations will be (where G denotes greedy action selection): \\[v_{0} \\xrightarrow[]{EI} v_{1} \\xrightarrow[]{EI} v_{2}  \\ldots \\xrightarrow[]{EI} v_{*} \\xrightarrow[]{G} \\pi_{*}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: Value iteration (Sutton and Barto 2018).",

    "text": "8.7 Generalized policy iteration\nGeneralised Policy Iteration (GPI) is the process of letting policy evaluation and policy improvement interact, independent of granularity. For instance, improvement/evaluation can be performed by doing complete sweeps of the state space (policy iteration), or improve the state-value using a single sweep of the state space (value iteration). GPI can also do asynchronous updates of the state-value where states are updated individually, in any order. This can significantly improve computation. Examples on asynchronous DP are\n\nIn-place DP mentioned in Section Section 8.3 where instead of keeping a copy of the old and new value function in each value-iteration update, you can just update the value functions in-place. Hence asynchronous updates in other parts of the state-space will directly be affected resulting in faster updates.\nPrioritized sweeping where we keep track of how “effective” or “significant” updates to our state-values are. States where the updates are more significant are likely further away from converging to the optimal value. As such, we would like to update them first. For this, we would compute the Bellman error: \\[|v_{k+1}(s) - v_k(s)|,\\] and keep these values in a priority queue. You can then efficiently pop the top of it to always get the state you should update next.\nPrioritize local updates where you update nearby states given the current state, e.g. if your robot is in a particular region of the grid, it is much more important to update nearby states than faraway ones.\n\nGPI works and will convergence to the optimal policy and optimal value function if the states are visited (in theory) an infinite number of times. That is, you must explore the whole state space for GPI to work.",

Are you stuck, see the help page. Sometimes hints and solutions can be revealed. Beware, you will not learn by giving up too early. Put some effort into finding a solution!\n\n8.10.1 Exercise - Gambler’s problem\nWe work with the gambler’s problem in Exercise 6.6.3.\nConsider this section in the Colab notebook to see the questions. Use your own copy if you already have one.\n\n\n8.10.2 Exercise - Maintenance problem\nAt the beginning of each day a piece of equipment is inspected to reveal its actual working condition. The equipment will be found in one of the working conditions \\(s = 1,\\ldots, N\\) where the working condition \\(s\\) is better than the working condition \\(s+1\\).\nThe equipment deteriorates in time. If the present working condition is \\(s\\) and no repair is done, then at the beginning of the next day the equipment has working condition \\(s'\\) with probability \\(q_{ss'}\\). It is assumed that \\(q_{ss'}=0\\) for \\(s'&lt;s\\) and \\(\\sum_{s'\\geq s}q_{ss'}=1\\).\nThe working condition \\(s=N\\) represents a malfunction that requires an enforced repair taking two days. For the intermediate states \\(s\\) with \\(1&lt;s&lt;N\\) there is a choice between preventively repairing the equipment and letting the equipment operate for the present day. A preventive repair takes only one day. A repaired system has the working condition \\(s=1\\).\nThe cost of an enforced repair upon failure is \\(C_{f}\\) and the cost of a preemptive repair in working condition \\(s\\) is \\(C_{p,s}\\). We wish to determine a maintenance rule which minimizes the repair cost.\nThe problem can be formulated as an MDP. Since an enforced repair takes two days and the state of the system has to be defined at the beginning of each day, we need an auxiliary state for the situation in which an enforced repair is in progress already for one day.\n\nDefine the state space \\(\\mathcal{S}\\), i.e. the the set of possible states of the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\mathcal{S}=\\{1,2,\\ \\ldots,\\ N,\\ N+1\\}.\\] State \\(s\\) with \\(1\\leq s\\leq N\\) corresponds to the situation in which an inspection reveals working condition \\(s\\), while state \\(N+1\\) corresponds to the situation in which an enforced repair is in progress already for one day.\n\n\n\nConsider actions \\[\na=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\n0 & \\text{if no repair.}\\\\\n1 & \\text{if preventive repair.}\\\\\n2 & \\text{if forced repair.}\\\\\n\\end{array}\\right.\n\\] Define the action space \\(\\mathcal{A}(s)\\) for all states \\(s\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe set of possible actions in state \\(s\\) is chosen as \\[\\mathcal{A}(1)=\\{0\\},\\ \\mathcal{A}(s)=\\{0,1\\} \\text{ for } 1&lt;s&lt;N, \\mathcal{A}(N)=\\mathcal{A}(N+1)=\\{2\\}.\\]\n\n\n\nAssume that the number of possible working conditions equals \\(N=5\\).

This also results in a higher disconted cost, since costs in the future have higher weight. The optimal policy looks a bit different compared to the policy we found for \\(\\gamma = 0.6\\). However, if the policy is the same for two different discount rates then you will have the same rewards/costs and hence the same cost of the policy. The discounted cost will not be the same since you use the discount rate to say how much you value the future.\n\n\n8.10.3 Exercise - Car rental\nConsider the car rental problem in Exercise 7.8.2. Note the inventory dynamics (number of cars) at each parking lot is independent of the other given an action \\(a\\). Let us consider Location 1 and assume that we are in state \\(x\\) and chose action \\(a\\).\nThe reward equals the reward of rentals minus the cost of movements. Note we have \\(\\bar{x} = x - a\\) and \\(\\bar{y} = x + a\\) after movement. Hence \\[r(s,a) = \\mathbb{E}[10(\\min(D_1, \\bar{x}) + \\min(D_2, \\bar{y}) )-2\\mid a \\mid]\\] where \\[\\mathbb{E}[\\min(D, z)] = \\sum_{i=0}^{z-1} i\\Pr(D = i) + \\Pr(D \\geq z)z.\\]\nLet us make a reward function in R:\n\n# Mean of min(D,z). Assume z &gt;= 0\nmeanMinD &lt;- function(z, lambda) {\n   if (z == 0) return(0)\n   sum(dpois(0:(z-1), lambda) * 0:(z-1)) + ppois(z-1, lambda, lower.tail = F) * z\n}\n\nreward &lt;- function(x, y, a) {\n   10 * meanMinD(x-a, 3) + 10 * meanMinD(y+a, 4) - 2 * abs(a)\n}\n\nreward(20, 0, 0)\n#&gt; [1] 30\nreward(20, 0, 5)\n#&gt; [1] 55.9\n\nLet us have a look at the state transition, the number of cars after rental requests \\(\\bar{x} - \\min(D_1, \\bar{x})\\). Next, the number of returned cars are added: \\(\\bar{x} - \\min(D_1, \\bar{x}) +  H_1\\). Finally, note that if this number is above 20 (parking lot capacity), then we only have 20 cars, i.e. the inventory dynamics (number of cars at the end of the day) is \\[X = \\min(20,  \\bar{x} - \\min(D_1, \\bar{x}) +  H_1))).\\] Similar for Location 2, if \\(\\bar{y}= y+a\\) we have \\[Y = \\min(20, \\bar{y} - \\min(D_2, \\bar{y}) + H_2)).\\]\nSince the dynamics is independent given action a, the transition probabilities can be split: \\[ p((x',y') | (x,y), a) = p(x' | x, a) p(y' | y, a).\\]\nLet us consider Location 1. If \\(x' &lt; 20\\) then \\[\n\\begin{align}\n   p(x' | x, a) &= \\Pr(x' = x-a - \\min(D_1, x-a) +  H_1)\\\\\n                &= \\Pr(x' = \\bar{x} - \\min(D_1, \\bar{x}) +  H_1)\\\\\n                &= \\Pr(H_1 - \\min(D_1, \\bar{x}) = x' - \\bar{x}) \\\\\n                &= \\sum_{i=0}^{\\bar{x}} \\Pr(\\min(D_1, \\bar{x}) = i)\\Pr(H_1 = x' - \\bar{x} + i) \\\\\n                &= \\sum_{i=0}^{\\bar{x}}\\left( (\\mathbf{1}_{(i&lt;\\bar{x})} \\Pr(D_1 = i) + \\mathbf{1}_{(i=\\bar{x})} \\Pr(D_1 \\geq \\bar{x}))\\Pr(H_1 = x' - \\bar{x} + i)\\right) \\\\\n                &= p(x' | \\bar{x}).\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIf \\(x' = 20\\) then \\[\n\\begin{align}\n   p(x' | x, a) &= \\Pr(20 \\leq \\bar{x} - \\min(D_1, \\bar{x}) +  H_1)\\\\\n                &= \\Pr(H_1 - \\min(D_1, \\bar{x}) \\geq 20 - \\bar{x}) \\\\\n                &= \\sum_{i=0}^{\\bar{x}} \\Pr(\\min(D_1, \\bar{x}) = i)\\Pr(H_1 \\geq 20 - \\bar{x} + i) \\\\\n                &= \\sum_{i=0}^{\\bar{x}}\\left( (\\mathbf{1}_{(i&lt;\\bar{x})} \\Pr(D_1 =i) + \\mathbf{1}_{(i=\\bar{x})} \\Pr(D_1 \\geq \\bar{x}))\\Pr(H_1 \\geq 20 - \\bar{x} + i)\\right)\\\\\n                &= p(x' = 20 | \\bar{x}).\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSimilar for Location 2.

Good coding conventions result in precise, readable, and unambiguous source code that is consistent with other language conventions and as intuitive as possible.\nDifferent ways of naming you variables exists. You are advised to adopt a naming convention. PEP 8 is the official style guide for Python code. It provides conventions for writing readable, consistent, and maintainable Python programs.

Below are some advises on how to help yourself and ask for help:\nIf you have a question:\n\nAsk it during the lecture or in the breaks\nUse generative AI (Gemini, ChatGPT, Copilot, …) as your mentor. It is in general good at giving hints for programming tasks. Note use it as a mentor and not as a giving you the solution. For instance, ask “Given me an example on a Hello world procedure in Python. Explain careful the code\nGoogle is your friend. This is always the next step. Try searches like “python dfply mask”, “python pandas”, etc.\nAbout programming errors. First try to understand the error message and solve the problem. Then you may\n\nTry to debug your code by inserting print statements in your code or run single lines using cmd+shift+enter.\nUse a debugger. Further details about debugging can be seen [here][colab-debug-python].\n\n\nIf you can’t find an answer then it is time to ask on-line. I recommend asking a question at stackoverflow. To make your question effective, the idea is to make things as easy as possible for someone to answer. This stack overflow thread How to make a great R reproducible example? give you some good hints. The process of providing a good minimal reproducible example (reprex) often causes you to answer your own question!
