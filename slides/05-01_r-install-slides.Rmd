## R

- R is a programming language and free software environment.
- We are using R via RStudio (an IDE). 
- R is like a car's engine while RStudio is like a car's dashboard.
- You can access RStudio using either: [RStudio Cloud][rstudio-cloud] (this is link to the workspace) or RStudio installed on your laptop (R must also be installed too).
- We will mostly use RStudio Cloud.

```{r, include=FALSE}
file.copy("../book/img/R_vs_RStudio_1.png", "img/R_vs_RStudio_1.png", overwrite = T)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/R_vs_RStudio_1.png")
```

## R vs Excel/VBA

- Excel
  * Initial learning curve is quite minimal.
  * Analysis can be done via point-and-click. 
  * It's not exceedingly hard to make basic graphs and charts. 
- R
  * A programming language, meaning the initial learning curve is steeper. 
  * Use command-line or script file.
  * It will take you some time to become familiar with the interface and master the various functions. 
- VBA
  * Compiled language.

## Cloud vs laptop version (cons)

.pull-left[
__Cloud ([RStudio Cloud][rstudio-cloud])__

- There is a limit on user time and CPU time. You need to pay if need more time. 
- Often slower than the desktop version. 
- Need an internet connection. 
- Risky to use at the exam if the internet connection is slow or is down. Use the laptop version instead.
]

- You need to install R and RStudio to get started.
- Packages must be installed.
- Other needed programs may have to be installed.
- Updates must be installed.
