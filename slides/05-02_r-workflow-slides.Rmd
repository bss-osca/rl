## R basics

Basic use of R (the code is in the subfolder _lecture_ in the project):
```{r}
8738787213 / 1653   # as a calculator
"Lars"  # a character/string
c(1,4)  # a vector
1:4 # a vector (sequence)
```

---

## R basics

```{r}
age <- c(12, 56, 34)  # assignment to object 
name <- c("Hans", "Sille", "Bo")  # character vector
people <- data.frame(Name = name, Age = age)  # data frame
people  # print object
people[1,]  # subsetting 1. row
people$Name  # column Name
```

---

## R basics

```{r}
lst <- list(p = people, status = 0, log = "Okay")  # a list (most abstract object)
lst
```

- The most commonly used way to store data is using a data frame, where each row represents an observation, and each column a variable.

---

## Your Turn

.your-turn[

Use R to 

- Extract column `Age` from `people`.
- Extract the age of Hans from `people`.
- Use `class` to find the data type of `p` in `lst`.
- Why does this code not work?
```r
x <- 2
Y <- 4
x + y
```
- Define a list with a vector, a number, a string and a boolean.
]

```{r echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 5, top = "0")
```

???

```{r}
people$Age
people[1, 2] # or
people[people$Name == "Hans", "Age"]
class(lst$p)
# R is case sensitive
list(v = c(1,2), n = 3, s = "foo", l = TRUE)
```

## Functions

- A function have inputs and outputs.
- Functions are often used to encapsulate a sequence of expressions that need to be executed numerous times, perhaps under slightly different conditions. 
- In programming, functional programming is a programming paradigm, a style how code is written. Rather than repeating code, functions and control structures allow one to build code in blocks. 
- Functions are (often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses.

```{r eval=FALSE}
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

---

## Your Turn

.your-turn[

- Create a vector `v` with numbers 2, 4, 6, 8 [see the help for function `seq` by writing `?seq` in the console and having a look at the examples]. 
- What is the sum of `v`?
- What is the sum of the numbers in `x <- c(1:4, NA)` [see `?sum`]?
- Does `x` contain a missing value (`NA`) [see `?is.na`]
- Convert `s <- "1.2"` to a number [see `?as.numeric`].
- What is the return value of `class(x)`?
- Set `y <- NULL` and check if `y` is null [see `?NULL`]. 
- Set `lst <- list(x = 3, y = "foo")` and check if `lst` contains an object `z` [use `is.null`].
]

```{r echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 5)
```

## R packages

- In R, the fundamental unit of shareable code is the package.
- As of April 2020, there are over 15,000 packages available on the **C**omprehensive **R** **A**rchive **N**etwork (CRAN), the public clearing house for R packages. 
- This huge variety of packages is one reason why R is so successful: the chances are that someone has already solved a problem that youâ€™re working on, and you can benefit from their work by downloading their package.
- Using R packages:
  - Install them from CRAN with `install.packages("x")`.
  - Install from GitHub using `remotes::install_github(path)`.
  - Use them in R with `library(x)` or `x::<function>`.
  - Use `?x` the see the help pages.

## Pipes

Use the pipe `%>%` operator for expressing a sequence of multiple operations (Ctrl+Shift+M). Value `log2(sqrt(16))` using pipes:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)   # define the pipe operator
x <- 16
x %>% sqrt() %>% log2()
```
The pipe _sends_ the result of the left side of the pipe to be the first argument of the function on the right side of the pipe. 

$$ \mbox{original data (x)}
\rightarrow \mbox{ sqrt }
\rightarrow \mbox{ log2 } $$

That is, we take what is left of the arrow (the object `x`) and put it into the function on the right of the arrow. 

---

## Your Turn

.your-turn[
Use pipes to calculate 

```{r}
x <- c(1:4, NA, 34)
x <- x^2
x <- sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)
x <- sqrt(x)
x
```
]

```{r echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 5)
```

???

```{r}
x <- c(1:4, NA, 34)^2 %>% sum() %>% sqrt() # or
x
x <- c(1:4, NA, 34) %>% `^`(2) %>% sum() %>% sqrt()
x
```


```{r copy, include=FALSE}
file.copy(list.files(pattern = ".html"), "../docs/slides/", overwrite = T)
file.copy("./slides.css", "./libs/", overwrite = T)
file.copy("libs", "../docs/slides/", recursive = T)
file.copy("img", "../docs/slides/", recursive = T)
system2("Rscript", args = "-e 'rmarkdown::render(\"index.Rmd\", quiet = TRUE)'")
```

```{r links, child="links.md", include=FALSE}
