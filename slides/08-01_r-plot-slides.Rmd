## Data visualization

> *"The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst's mind than any other device." --- John Tukey*

- Data visualization is the creation and study of the visual representation of data.
- There are many tools for visualizing data (R is one of them), and many approaches/systems within R for making data visualizations (**ggplot2** is one of them, and that's what we're going to use).

## ggplot2 a part of tidyverse

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ggplot2-part-of-tidyverse.png")
```
] 
.pull-right[ 
- **ggplot2** is tidyverse's data visualization package - The `gg` in "ggplot2" stands for Grammar of Graphics 
- It is inspired by the book **Grammar of Graphics** by Leland Wilkinson
]

## Grammar of Graphics

A grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/grammar-of-graphics.png")
```

## An example

```{r out.width="70%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Starwars characters",
       x = "Height (cm)", y = "Weight (kg)")
```

---

.question[ 
- What are the functions doing?
- What is the dataset being plotted?
- Which variable is on the x-axis and which variable is on the y-axis?
- What does the warning mean?
]

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Mass vs. height of Starwars characters",
    x = "Height (cm)", 
    y = "Weight (kg)"
    )
```

    ## Warning: Removed 28 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

---

## Hello ggplot2!

- `ggplot()` is the main function in ggplot2
- Plots are constructed in layers
- Structure of the code for plots can be summarized as

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = [dataset], 
       mapping = aes(x = [x-variable], y = [y-variable])) +
   geom_xxx() +
   other options
```

- To use ggplot2 functions, first load tidyverse

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

- For help with the ggplot2, see [ggplot2.tidyverse.org](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

# Visualizing Star Wars

Let us consider the R markdown document.




```{r copy, include=FALSE}
file.copy(list.files(pattern = ".html"), "../docs/slides/", overwrite = T)
file.copy("./slides.css", "./libs/", overwrite = T)
file.copy("libs", "../docs/slides/", recursive = T)
file.copy("img", "../docs/slides/", recursive = T)
system2("Rscript", args = "-e 'rmarkdown::render(\"index.Rmd\", quiet = TRUE)'")
```

```{r links, child="links.md", include=FALSE}
```
