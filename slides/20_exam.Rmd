## How to prepare for the exam

.pull-left[ 
The best way prepare for the exam is to redo all the exercises:

* Hide your previous solution.
* Solve the exercise. If you have problems recap the stuff that you don't understand in the curriculum and have a look in the hidden solution.
* Repeat until you can solve the exercise without help.
