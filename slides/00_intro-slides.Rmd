## Who are you?

Let us have a look at [what you answered](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Cmc5bXlNiJnU8FbCF3TIi_SL8X-Wm0wqlkYGV3SBxpM/edit#responses).

## Course overview 

- The purpose of this course is to give an introduction and knowledge about reinforcement learning (RL).
- RL refers to:
  * An approach of modelling sequential decision making problems.
  * An approach for learning decision making form experience.
  * Mathematical models for learning-based decision making.
- Lectures/tutorials each week.
- Exercises are given to support your learning.

---

## Teaching form and style 

- A combination of lectures and tutorials. 
  - Before: Read the suggested material (you may start with the exercises).
  - Lecture or tutorial. Not all material will be covered here.
  - Continue with exercises (group work).
- It is strongly recommended that you solve the exercises for each week during the course. This is the best way to prepare for the exam. 

---

## Course notes 

The course notes are given [online](https://bss-osca.github.io/rl/). You may annotate the notes and slides using [hypothes.is](https://bss-osca.github.io/rl/annotate.html). Link to slides are given under the **Recap** section in each learning module.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"} 
knitr::include_graphics("./img/online-site.png") 
```

---

## Groups 

- I recommend that you form groups of 3-6 persons that you use throughout the whole course. 
- It is up to you how to meet in these groups (on-line or physical). 
- Use the groups when you 
  * solve the exercises. 
  * hand in the project report.

---

## Project report

- A project report must be written during the course focussing on solving a RL problem.
- The report may be used as a starting point for discussion at the individual exam.
- You must hand in the reports in groups and do individual peer grading using the on-line platform [Peergrade].

---

## Exam

- A 20 min oral individual exam without any preparation. 
- Curriculum include all material such as book chapters, course notes, videos, interactive tutorials, exercises and project reports.
- The report may be used as a starting point for discussion at the individual exam.
