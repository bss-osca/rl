# (PART) Introduction {-}

# An introduction to RL {#mod-rl-intro}

This module gives a short introduction to VBA. In general syllabus will point to chapters in @vba-book; however, there is a lot for videos about VBA online such as course [14-Hour VBA Course][vba-yt-course2]. You may have a look at these videos instead if you prefer a different learning style. In the learning path diagram links to alternative online content will be pointed out. Note this is alternatives to the standard learning path that you may use instead. The learning path may also have extra content that is not a part of syllabus you can have a look at.

Since Excel change as new versions arrive and it work on different operating systems, the look in the screenshots and videos might be a bit different from your version. However, you still should be able to understand it.

## What is VBA {#vba-what}

Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is an implementation of the BASIC programming language intended to control and automate Microsoft Office applications, developed by Microsoft. For instance, you can automatically create sheets, delete objects, create user-defined functions or read/write data to a sheet. It is not a standalone program, it can only run in the host application. In this course we will focus on running VBA from Excel. VBA is widely used in the industry (specially linked to Excel) and easy to learn. Microsoft stopped investing in VBA in 2008. It only update it for small changes. However, VBA is still a vital part of desktop Office applications, and will continue to be so in the future. 

VBA is a [compiled language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language#:~:text=A%20compiled%20language%20is%20a,%2Druntime%20translation%20takes%20place) implemented using compilers (translators that generate machine code from source code). That is, code need to be compiled first before running it. You can only run VBA using the desktop version of Excel. That is, you can't create, run, or edit VBA in Excel for the web. 

With VBA you can extend Excel and automate tasks by coding different algorithms that for instance can be run by pressing a button. Since VBA is a programming language, the initial learning curve is steeper compared to Excel. However, you will get started fast because you already know Excel.

  
## Your first program {#vba-hello}

We will use the book _VBA Programming in Business Economics_ by @vba-book. Read Chapter 1 in @vba-book. You may also have a look at the alternative videos instead as listed in the learning path diagram (select only one of the video paths).


## The macro recorder {#vba-macro}

It is possible to use the Macro recorder to turn your actions in Excel into VBA code. This can be particularly useful if you have forgotten the code for a specific color or the name of a function. Unfortunately, you cannot record if-statements or loops, so the recorder is not an easy way out of learning to code. But it is a handy tool.

Read Chapter 2 in @vba-book. You may also have a look at the alternative videos instead as listed in the learning path diagram (select only one of the video paths).


## A short overview

Read Chapter 3 in @vba-book which gives a short overview over VBA so you can get started coding.  


## Recap {#rc-vba-intro}

This module gives a short introduction to VBA which is: 

- A programming language intended to control and automate Microsoft Office applications (we use Excel).
- VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) is an implementation of BASIC developed by Microsoft. 
- A [compiled language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language#:~:text=A%20compiled%20language%20is%20a,%2Druntime%20translation%20takes%20place). That is, code need to be compiled first before running it. 
- You can only run VBA using the desktop version of Excel (not the web version).
- With VBA you can extend Excel and automate tasks by coding different algorithms that for instance can be run by pressing a button. 

For running VBA code the **Developer** tab needs to be visible in Excel. This can be done by check marking the **Developer** tab under the 'Ribbon and Toolbar' options in Excel. You add it by choosing **Excel -> Preferences -> Ribbon and toolbar** (`r icons::fontawesome$brands$apple`) or right click a tab and choose **Customize ribbon ...** (`r icons::fontawesome$brands$windows`).

In the **Developer** tab you open the VBA editor by pressing the **Visual basic** button (`r icons::fontawesome$brands$windows` Alt + F11, `r icons::fontawesome$brands$apple` ⌥ + F11).

A few useful shortcuts:

- Toggle VBA editor and Excel (`r icons::fontawesome$brands$windows` Alt + F11, `r icons::fontawesome$brands$apple` ⌘⇧´).
- Run current procedure or continues execution after pausing (F5).
<!-- - Terminate a procedure and reset all variables to their default values (Shift + F5). -->
- Auto complete code (Ctrl + Space). On a mac you may have to disable the default shortcut (Ctrl + Space) for switching input sources. You can go to the System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Input Sources and disable it.
- Use the debugger and go to next line of code (`r icons::fontawesome$brands$windows` F8, `r icons::fontawesome$brands$apple` ⇧⌘I).
<!-- - Open the Object Browser (F2). -->
- Switch between subs/functions (`r icons::fontawesome$brands$windows`  Ctrl + Up/Down, `r icons::fontawesome$brands$apple` ⌘ + Up/Down).
<!-- - Run Debugger to this line (Ctrl + F8). -->

Basic building blocks in programming:

- _Variables_ store stuff in memory.
- _Procedures_ (functions and subs) execute a set of instructions.
- _Conditional statements_ (decisions) are used to execute different instructions depending on a true/false statement.
- _Loops_ are used to execute code repeatedly. 
- _Input/output_ are needed to read data and output the result.

Variables are used to store information in the program. Think of it as a box that can contain e.g. a number, a string or and array of integers. The variable name is the label on the box.

In VBA we deal with two kinds of procedures: A `Sub` which can work as a “macro” in Excel, i.e. we can call it using e.g. a button and a `Function` which can work like Excel functions, i.e. return a value.

Examples on input/output are dialog boxes which can be created using `MsgBox` or `InputBox`. You can also write/read values from a sheet using `Range` or `Cells`. Note it is always a good idea to know which sheet you are considering use the `Worksheets` function.

Conditional statements (decisions) execute different instructions depending on a true/false. 

Loops can be used to execute code repeatedly.

Excel functions can be called with the `WorksheetFunction` e.g. `WorksheetFunction.Sum(Range("D2:E5"))`

## Exercises {#ex-vba-intro}

`r strExercises`

### Exercise - Hello {#ex-vba-hello}

   (1) Based on Chapter 1 in @vba-book, create your own "Hello World" macro.
   (2) Create a new procedure
   
```
Public Sub MyHello() 
   Dim name as String 
   Name = InputBox("Type your name:")
   MsgBox("Hello " & Name)
End Sub
```

   (3) Run it using a button and using the shortcut F5. 
   


### Exercise - Record a macro {#ex-vba-macro}
   
Do the following steps:

   (1) Type 'My name is:' in cell A1. 
   (2) Type you name in cell B1 and activate it (click on it).
   (3) Start the macro recorder and call the macro `ChangeLayout`.
   (4) Change the color to blue and font size to 14.
   (5) Stop the macro recorder.
   (6) Activate cell A1 and run the macro.
   (7) Open the VBA editor and inspect the macro. 
   (8) Cleanup the macro so only stuff about color and size are maintained.
   (9) Add a button to run the macro.
   (10) Add numbers to cells A3:D3, select the cells and run the macro.
   (11) Modify the macro in the editor so the font size is 10 and test it.


### Exercise - User input {#ex-vba-user-input}

Write a procedure (sub) `CheckNumber` that:

   (1) Ask for a number using an input box.
   (2) Make a message box telling if the number is above 10.
   (3) Write the number to a cell.
   
Remember to save the file as a macro-enabled workbook (xlsm).   


### Exercise - Max and min number {#ex-vba-max-min}

The [file](https://github.com/bss-osca/tfa/blob/master/vba/vba-max-min-template.xlsm) contains a procedure to generate 40 random numbers.

```{r, hint=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
Sub FindMax()
    Dim m As Integer
    m = 0
    For r = 1 To 40
        If Cells(r, 1) ___ m Then
            m = ___
        End If
    Next
    Range("D1") = ___
End Sub
```

   (1) Create a procedure that finds the maximum number and write it to cell D1. Assign the procedure to button _Find max_.
   (2) Create a procedure that finds the minimum number and write it to cell D2. Assign the procedure to button _Find min_.
   (3) Create a procedure that finds the number range and write it to cell D3. Assign the procedure to button _Find range_. Given two numbers `m1` and `m2`, you can concatenate them to a string using `&` e.g. `"[" & m1 & "," & m2 & "]"`.
   (4) Create a procedure that count the number of positives and write it to cell D4. Assign the procedure to button _Count positives_.
   
It may often be nice to know the row number of the minimum and maximum values.

   (5) Create a procedure that finds the maximum row number and write it to cell D5. Assign the procedure to button _Find max row_.
   (6) Create a procedure that finds the minimum row number and write it to cell D6. Assign the procedure to button _Find min row_.
   
The procedure `RunAll` which is already linked to button _Run All_, runs all the procedures. Have a look at the code and try it out.
