# (PART) Getting started with R {-} 

# Setting up R {#mod-r-install}

[R] is a programming language and free software environment. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. For a further overview and description of the history of R see [Chapter 2](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/history-and-overview-of-r.html) in @rdpeng. R can be run from a terminal but in general you use an IDE (integrated development environment) [RStudio] for running R and to saving your work.

R and RStudio can either be run from your laptop or using [RStudio Cloud][rstudio-cloud] which run R in the cloud using your browser. During this course it is recommend to use RStudio Cloud at much as possible; however, you also need to have R and RStudio installed on your laptop in case that the cloud service is down/not working. Some pros and cons of using R in the cloud vs on the laptop are 

__Cloud ([RStudio Cloud][rstudio-cloud])__

Pros:

- Log in and you are ready to use R.
- No need to download anything.
- Packages easier to install.
- Everything can be run using a browser.

Cons:

- There is a limit on user time and CPU time. You need to pay if need more time. 
- Often slower than the desktop version. 
- Need an internet connection. 
- Risky to use at the exam if the internet connection is slow or is down. Use the laptop version instead.

__Laptop ([R] and [RStudio])__

Pros:

- Can be used without any internet connection.
- No limit on user time and CPU usage.
- Good if computations takes a lot of time.

Cons:

- You need to install R and RStudio to get started.
- Packages must be installed.
- Other needed programs may have to be installed.
- Updates must be installed.

We are all different and you may like different learning styles compared to others. In the learning path diagram, there may be links to alternative online content. Note this is an alternative to the standard learning path that you may use instead. The learning path may also have extra content, that is not a part of syllabus, you can have a look at.

## Learning outcomes {#lo-r-install}

By the end of this module, you are expected to have:

* Installed R and RStudio on your laptop.
* Tested R and RStudio on your laptop. <!--  and Git. -->
* Installed some packages on your laptop
<!-- * Installed Git. -->
* Signed up on [RStudio Cloud][rstudio-cloud] and tested it. 

The learning outcomes relate to the [overall learning goal](#lg-course) number 5 of the course.



## Install R and RStudio {#r-install}

[R] is a programming language and free software environment. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. For a further overview and description of the history of R see [Chapter 2](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/history-and-overview-of-r.html) in @rdpeng. To run R you need to install it on your computer. Moreover, you need the IDE (integrated development environment) [RStudio] to save your work.

<div class = "boxTask">
`r addIcon("tasks", attrib = list(class = "fa-pull-right fa-5x iconStyle1"))`  

* Install R from [CRAN][cran] (Comprehensive R Archive Network). Install the latest precompiled binary distribution for your operating system (use the links up at the top of the CRAN page).
* Install the desktop version of [RStudio][rstudio-download], a powerful user interface for R. 
<!-- * Install the latest version of [Git][git-install]. If you have problems, see [here][hg-install-git]. -->
* Under Windows it is a good idea to always open R with administrator rights: 
   - Add a shortcut for RStudio (e.g. to the taskbar or desktop).
   - Ctrl+Shift+Right-Click the shortcut and choose **Properties**:
     
     ![Choose Properties](img/win_admin1.png)
   - Under **Shortcut** click **Advanced** and set **Run as administrator** 
     
     ![](img/win_admin3.png)
     
     You now always can open RStudio with this shortcut. 
</div>
    
If you have a pre-existing installation of R and/or RStudio, reinstall both to the latest versions. It can be considerably harder to run old software than new. To update your R version you may use the [intallr](https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/pandoc/installr.html) package.


### Test your installation

<div class = "boxTask">`r addIcon("tasks", attrib = list(class = "fa-pull-right fa-5x iconStyle1"))`  

* Do whatever is appropriate for your OS to launch RStudio. You should get a window similar to the screenshot you have [here][rstudio-workbench], but yours will be more boring because you have not written any code or made any figures yet.

* Put your cursor in the pane labeled Console, which is where you interact with the live R process. Create a simple object using code like `x <- 2 * 4` (followed by enter or return). Then inspect the `x` object by typing `x` followed by enter or return. You should see the value 8 print to screen. If yes, you have succeeded in installing R and RStudio.

* Try to open a new file **File > New File > New RMarkdown...**. Use the defaults and press **OK**. Next save the file and compile it using **Knit** (Ctrl+Shift+K). You have now compiled a document with R code embedded. 
</div>

### Add-on packages

R is an extensible system and many people share useful codes they have developed as a _package_ via CRAN or GitHub. To install a package from CRAN, for example the [dplyr][dplyr-cran] package for data manipulation, one way to do it is in the R console.

```r
install.packages("dplyr", dependencies = TRUE)
```

By including `dependencies = TRUE`, we are being explicit and extra careful to install any additional packages the target package, `dplyr` in the example above is dependent on. 

<div class = "boxTask">
`r addIcon("tasks", attrib = list(class = "fa-pull-right fa-5x iconStyle1"))`  

* Install the package [tidyverse][tidyverse-main-page] which is in fact a bundle of packages by running (note this operation may take a long time):

```r
install.packages("tidyverse", dependencies = TRUE)
```

* Check if you have successfully installed tidyverse by loading the package:

```r
library(tidyverse)
```

* If your install was unsuccessful try to install the packages who fails one by one.
</div>

You may also see this short [video][video-packages] explaining what packages are.


## Setup and test RStudio Cloud {#r-cloud}

RStudio Cloud works as your laptop version except that a workspace with projects for each module already is created. 

<div class = "boxTask">
`r addIcon("tasks", attrib = list(class = "fa-pull-right fa-5x iconStyle1"))`  

* Join the _Tools for Analytics_ workspace on [RStudio Cloud][rstudio-cloud] (signup if you have not done it yet).
* Click the _Projects_ link (in the top) and open the project _00-module-11_. A personal copy of the project is loaded for you.
* Put your cursor in the pane labeled Console, which is where you interact with the live R process. Create a simple object using code like `x <- 2 * 4` (followed by enter or return). Then inspect the `x` object by typing `x` followed by enter or return. You should see the value 8 print to screen. 
* Try to open a new file **File > New File > New RMarkdown...**. Use the defaults and press **OK**. Next save the file and compile it using **Knit** (Ctrl+Shift+K). You have now compiled a document with R code embedded.
