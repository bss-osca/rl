## Setup project
# - Add groups in BS My Course > Groups > New Category (# of Groups â€“ Self-Enrolment)
# - Add post:
# Dear students
# 
# For the projects, I need you to add yourself to a group on BS. In general, you may use the groups you already use at the study cafes. However, some may have been dissolved/changed. Given your group, each student in the group must go to My Course &gt; Groups and add their name to the group you chose.
# 
# I recommend that you are between 3 and 6 people in each group.
# 
# Note that your project solution will be used as a starting point at the exam. If you have not handed in a project, theoretical topics will be discussed instead at the exam. Hence, I highly recommend that you do the project!
#    
# Best Lars
