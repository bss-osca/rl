## Practicalities

- We will use Peergrade to make peer feedback on the projects. Remember to sign-up using this [link][peergrade-signup]. It is important that you use your university email as login! Please find a guide on how to use the system [here](https://help.peergrade.io/en/collections/437178-getting-started).
- I recommend that you write your project in groups. That is, each group only hands in once, and simply select the group members from a list in the system.
- All projects must be handed in using [Peergrade]. When the peer-grading period starts, you must do peer evaluation. This step is done individually.

The schedule for the project assignment is:

- 14/11 08:00: Project period starts. Sign-up before this date!
- 02/12 24:00: Deadline for handing in your solution. 
- 02/12 24:00: Peer grading starts.
- 06/12 10:00: Deadline for completing peer grading.


## Format

The project report consists of two parts. The first part contains a summary of all the exam-topics. For each topic write what you find important to emphasize (approx. one page for each topic). You may think it as a list you need to remember when you have to present at the exam (4-6 minutes).

The second part consists of an example where you try to solve a problem using RL. 


The exam is a 20 min oral individual exam without any preparation. Since we nee time for giving you the correct grade, this means that:

- The oral examination lasts 15 minutes exactly.
- You might be interrupted in the middle of a sentence which is not to be rude but to make sure we stick to the schedule.
- The exam will begin by you picking one of the exam-topics specified. For each topic prepare a 4-6 minutes pitch where you explain the core concepts and what you find important and relevant.
- We will use the last minutes to ask questions, e.g. about the example in your project report or link your pitch to other topics in the curriculum.

## Exam-topics

The following topics can be selected:

1) Multi-armed bandits
2) Markov decision processes (MDPs)
3) Policies and value functions for MDPs
4) Dynamic programming
5) Monte Carlo methods for prediction and control
6) Temporal difference methods for prediction
7) Temporal difference methods for control

Have a look at the learning goals for each topic to get an overview over the topic.
